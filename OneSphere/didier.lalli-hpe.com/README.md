This is Didier's contribution. It's in PowerShell and should be invoked with:

````
./challenge.ps1 -portal http://10.167.0.110 rollie@hpe.com Hpinvent@123 -sort region -descending
````

You can sort by zone (default), region, provider, zonetype or project using -sort
Default sort is ascending otherwise you can use -descending

Enjoy!
